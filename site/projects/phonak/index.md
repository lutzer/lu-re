*This project is an AR experience commissioned by Phonak to tease their new product Audéo Sphere Infinio. This hearing aid is the first one worldwide to use AI for emphasising that one conversation you want to listen to. By activating the DEEPSONIC chip, customers can experience the effect first hand.*

We picked the most busy street crossing we could find, Shibuya in Tokyo, to make the incredible effect of the chip DEEPSONIC tangible. Instead of showing the scenario in a realistic way we visualise a world of sound: people’s chatter, engines revving, cars honking. A second visualization of a neural network represents the inner workings of the DEEPSONIC noise reduction technology. 

By activating the chip in our Teaser users can sense the effect and both in visuals and audio: only the conversation you want to listen to stays.
