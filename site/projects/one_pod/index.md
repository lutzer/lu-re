### Adaptive Design for Universal Access
The concept vehicle features a flexible interior that can be reconfigured for various applications, including deployment as an autonomous taxi providing comprehensive "mobility as a service." Two expansive swing doors on one side ensure effortless entry and exit for all passengers, including those with accessibility requirements. Upon arrival, the OnePod intelligently detects the curb and automatically adjusts its interior floor to street level, providing seamless, step-free access for wheelchair users and families with prams.

### Intuitive User Experience
The vehicle incorporates advanced passenger recognition technology, automatically opening doors as users approach while displaying relevant information through an integrated door display. Thoughtfully designed control elements are embedded within adjustable armrests, enabling intuitive operation and remote control of the ceiling-mounted information display. Panoramic windows spanning the roof and sides offer passengers an immersive view of their surroundings.

### Smart Communication and Versatility
External communication is facilitated through intelligent light strip signals that inform and alert other road users. The OnePod also features a practical fold-down bicycle rack at the rear, complete with secure strapping systems for safe transport of bikes during journeys.

### My Contribution
My work focused on developing the passenger recognition system and optimizing the boarding experience. This involved creating seamless connectivity with users' smartphones and designing an integrated guidance system that utilizes a dedicated mobile app, exterior-mounted displays, and strategically placed visual elements both inside and outside the pod to facilitate smooth onboarding and offboarding procedures.
