The AR application guides visitors through the various stages of growth and transformation of the area at the physical city model – from the first settlements to the city's present expansion. On additional levels, the AR technology presents infrastructures and networks that shape the daily lives of residents, highlighting what makes life safe, mobile, and enjoyable, as well as aspects that sometimes strain communal living.

Through captivating moments in the experience, visitors are inspired to delve deeper into information that is often overlooked in traditional presentations. Artistic interpretations of architectural elements of security throughout time, piles of garbage falling onto the model or a visual representation of famous ceremonies keep younger audiences engaged.
